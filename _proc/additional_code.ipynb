    "The GUI code in `alphapept/gui` is not covered by notebooks. The reason for this is that a key feature of `streamlit` is that code changes can be directly displayed in the browser application. `streamlit` watches the `*.py`-files and automatically updates accordingly. Having an intermediate notebook that first needs to be run before the code changes are propagated would limit the coding experience with having live feedback of code changes.\n",
