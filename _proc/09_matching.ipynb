    "## Dataset Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "For matching MS2-identifications to MS1-features, we first need to align the datasets on top of each other to be able to transfer identifications correctly. Datasets are aligned by comparing shared precursors and calculating the median offset.\n",
    "When comparing all files to each other, we get an overdetermined linear equation system. By solving this, we find offset parameters that minimize the shift of all files to each other.\n",
    "Offset is either applied relative (mz, mobility) or absolute (rt).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relative offset\n",
    "\n",
    "For some parameters, we would like to have a relative correction of values. Consider the case of different `mz`-values, e.g. 300 and 600. If we assume that the offset is larger for larger m/z values, we would not want an absolute correction of e.g. +0.5 Da (300.5 and 600.5) but rather a relative correction of e.g. +0.1% (300.3 and 600.6).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absolute correction\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the relative correction, sometimes absolute correction is more applicable. Consider the case of retention time. Here one would rather not expect a relative offset but rather an absolute offset. As an example, consider a lag time of 0.5 Minutes. This would be constant for all retention times and not differ e.g., for later retention times."

    "Transfer MS2 identifications to similar MS1 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For \"match-between-runs\" we start with aligning datasets. To create a reference we use for matching, we combine all datasets of a matching group. When using the default settings, the matching group consists of all files. We then group the dataset by precursor and calculate it's average properties (rt, mz, mobility). By combining several files we further are able to calculate a standard deviation. This allows us to know where and with what deviation we would expect an MS1 feature and have the corresponding identification. This is our matching reference. In the matching step, we go through each dataset individually and check if there are precursors in the reference that were not identified in this dataset. We then perform a nearest-neighbor lookup to find if any MS1 features exist that are in close proximity to the reference. The distance metric we use is normed by the median standard of the deviation. Lastly we assess the confidence in a transfered identifcation by using the [`Mahalanobis`](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/331283/how-to-calculate-the-probability-of-a-data-point-belonging-to-a-multivariate-nor) distance."
