    "## Installation Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) Python distribution, which comes with a powerful package manager. See below for additional instructions for Linux and Mac as they require additional installation of Mono to use the RawFileReader.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is strongly recommended to install AlphaPept in its own environment.\n",
    "1. Open the console and create a new conda environment: `conda create --name alphapept python=3.8`\n",
    "2. Activate the environment: `conda activate alphapept`\n",
    "3. Redirect to the folder of choice and clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapept.git`\n",
    "4. Navigate to the alphapept folder with `cd alphapept` and install the package with `pip install .` (default users) or with `pip install -e .` to enable developers mode.\n",
    "5. To ensure compatibility, install strict requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If AlphaPept is installed correctly, you should be able to import Alphapept as a package within the environment; see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GPU Support\n",
    "To enable usage of a GPU, additional packages need to be installed. The following instructions are targeted at a more experienced audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to have a working [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) installation that is compatible with cupy. To check type `nvcc --version` in your terminal.\n",
    "2. Install [cupy](https://cupy.dev). Make sure to install the cupy version matching your CUDA toolkit (e.g. `pip install cupy-cuda110` for CUDA toolkit 11.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "* If you would like to use alphapept in your jupyter notebook environment, additionally install nb_conda: `conda install nb_conda`, which also installs the jupyter notebook extensions. They can be called from a running jupyter instance like so: `http://localhost:8888/nbextensions`. \n",
    "* For navigating the notebooks, the exension `collapsible headings` and `toc2` are very beneficial.\n",
    "* For developing with the notebooks, see the `nbev` section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the build-essentials: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`.\n",
    "2. Install Mono from mono-project website [Mono Linux](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin). NOTE, the installed mono version should be at least 6.10, which requires you to add the ppa to your trusted sources!\n",
    "3. Navigate to the alphapept folder and install the package with `pip install .` (default users) or with `pip install -e .` to enable developers mode.\n",
    "4. Install libgomp.1 with `sudo apt-get install libgomp1`.\n",
    "5. Copy-paste the Bruker library for feature finding to your /usr/lib folder with `sudo cp alphapept/ext/bruker/FF/linux64/alphapeptlibtbb.so.2 /usr/lib/libtbb.so.2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install [brew](https://brew.sh) and pkg-config: `brew install pkg-config`\n",
    "2. Intall Mono from mono-project website [Mono Mac](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)\n",
    "3. Register the Mono-Path to your system:\n",
    "For macOS Catalina, open the configuration of zsh via the terminal:\n",
    "* Type in `cd` to navigate to the home directory.\n",
    "* Type `nano ~/.zshrc` to open the configuration of the terminal\n",
    "* Add the path to your mono installation: `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/6.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH`. Make sure that the Path matches to your version (Here 6.12.0)\n",
    "* Save everything and execute `. ~/.zshrc` \n",
    "4. Navigate to the alphapept folder and install the package with `pip install .` (default users) or with `pip install -e .` to enable developers mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standalone Windows Installer\n",
    "To use AlphaPept as a stand-alone program for end-users, it can be installed on Windows machines via a one-click installer. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapept/releases/latest).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    " > To access Thermo files, we have integrated [RawFileReader](https://planetorbitrap.com/rawfilereader) into AlphaPept. We rely on [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) for Linux/Mac systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " > To access Bruker files, we rely on the `timsdata`-library. Currently, only Windows is supported. For feature finding, we use the Bruker Feature Finder, which can be found in the `ext` folder of this repository."
