    "## Installation Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) Python distribution, which comes with a powerful package manager. See below for additional instructions for Linux and Mac as they require additional installation of Mono to use the RawFileReader.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is strongly recommended to install AlphaPept in its own environment.\n",
    "1. Open the console and create a new conda environment: `conda create --name alphapept python=3`\n",
    "2. Activate the environment: `conda activate alphapept`\n",
    "3. Redirect to the folder of choice and clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapept.git`\n",
    "4. Navigate to the alphapept folder and install the package with `pip install .` (default users) or with `pip install -e .` to enable developers mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "If AlphaPept is installed correctly, you should be able to import Alphapept as a package within the environment; see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: If you would like to use alphapept in your jupyter notebook environment, additionally install nb_conda: `conda install nb_conda`. This also installs the jupyter notebook extensions. They can be called from a running jupyter instance like so: `http://localhost:8888/nbextensions`. For navigating the notebooks, the exension `collapsible headings` and `toc2` are very beneficial. For developing with the notebooks, see the `nbev` section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the build-essentials: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`\n",
    "2. Install Mono from mono-project website [Mono Linux](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin)\n",
    "3. Navigate to the alphapept folder and install the package with `pip install .` (default users) or with `pip install -e .` to enable developers mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install [brew](https://brew.sh) and pkg-config: `brew install pkg-config`\n",
    "2. Intall Mono from mono-project website [Mono Mac](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)\n",
    "3. Register the Mono-Path to your system:\n",
    "For macOS Catalina, open the configuration of zsh via the terminal:\n",
    "* Type in `cd` to navigate to the home directory.\n",
    "* Type `nano ~/.zshrc` to open the configuration of the terminal\n",
    "* Add the path to your mono installation: `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/6.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH`. Make sure that the Path matches to your version (Here 6.12.0)\n",
    "* Save everything and execute `. ~/.zshrc` \n",
    "4. Navigate to the alphapept folder and install the package with `pip install .` (default users) or with `pip install -e .` to enable developers mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standalone Windows Installer\n",
    "To use AlphaPept as a stand-alone program for end-users, it can be installed on Windows machines via a one-click installer. Download the latest version [here](http://alphapept.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "> To access Thermo files, we have integrated [RawFileReader](https://planetorbitrap.com/rawfilereader) into AlphaPept. We rely on [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) for Linux/Mac systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To access Bruker files, we rely on the `timsdata`-library. Currently, only Windows is supported. For feature finding, we use the Bruker Feature Finder, which can be found in the `ext` folder of this repository."

    "## How to use\n",
    "\n",
    "AlphaPept is meant to be a framework to implement and test new ideas quickly but also to serve as a performant processing pipeline. In principle, there are three use-cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GUI: Use the graphical user interface to select settings and process files manually.\n",
    "* CMD: Use the command-line interface to process files. Useful when building automatic pipelines.\n",
    "* Python: Use python modules to build individual workflows. Useful when building customized pipelines and using Python as a scripting language or when implementing new ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows Standalone Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the windows installation, simply click on the shortcut after installation. The windows installation also installs the command-line tool so that you can call alphapept via `alphapept` in the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Once AlphaPept is correctly installed, you can use it like any other python module."
