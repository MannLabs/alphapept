    "\n",
    "We highly recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) Python distribution, which comes with a powerful package manager. See below for additional instructions for Linux and Mac as they require additional installation of Mono to use the RawFileReader.\n",
    "\n",
    "AlphaPept can be used as an application as a whole or as a Python Package where individual modules are called. Depending on the use case, AlphaPept will need different requirements, and you might not want to install all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we have the default `requirements.txt`, additional requirements to run the GUI `gui` and packages used for developing `develop`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you can install AlphaPept in multiple ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The default `alphapept`\n",
    "- With GUI-packages `alphapept[gui]`\n",
    "- With pacakges for development `alphapept[develop]` (`alphapept[develop,gui]`) respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements typically contain pinned versions and will be automatically upgraded and tested with `dependabot`. This `stable` version allows having a reproducible workflow. However, in order to avoid conflicts with package versions that are too strict, the requirements are not pinned when being installed. To use the strict version use the `-stable`-flag, e.g. `alphapept[stable]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For end-users that want to set up a processing environment in Python, the `\"alphapept[stable,gui-stable]\"` is the `batteries-included`-version that you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "It is strongly recommended to install AlphaPept in its own environment.\n",
    "1. Open the console and create a new conda environment: `conda create --name alphapept python=3.8`\n",
    "2. Activate the environment: `conda activate alphapept`\n",
    "3. Install AlphaPept via pip: `pip install \"alphapept[stable,gui-stable]\"`. If you want to use AlphaPept as a package without the GUI dependencies and without strict version dependencies, use `pip install alphapept`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If AlphaPept is installed correctly, you should be able to import AlphaPept as a package within the environment; see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "#### Linux\n",
    "1. Install the build-essentials: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`.\n",
    "2. Install AlphaPept via pip: `pip install \"alphapept[stable,gui-stable]\"`. If you want to use AlphaPept as a package withouth the GUI dependencies and strict version dependencies use `pip install alphapept`.\n",
    "3. Install libgomp.1 with `sudo apt-get install libgomp1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bruker Support\n",
    "4. Copy-paste the Bruker library for feature finding to your /usr/lib folder with `sudo cp alphapept/ext/bruker/FF/linux64/alphapeptlibtbb.so.2 /usr/lib/libtbb.so.2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Thermo Support\n",
    "5. Install Mono from mono-project website [Mono Linux](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin). NOTE, the installed mono version should be at least 6.10, which requires you to add the ppa to your trusted sources!\n",

    "4. Install pythonnet with `pip install pythonnet==2.5.2`\n",

    "#### Developer\n",
    "1. Redirect to the folder of choice and clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapept.git`\n",
    "2. Navigate to the alphapept folder with `cd alphapept` and install the package with `pip install .` (default users) or with `pip install -e .` to enable developers mode. Note that you can use the different requirements here aswell (e.g. `pip install \".[gui-stable]\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GPU Support\n",
    "Some functionality of AlphaPept is GPU optimized that uses Nvidia's CUDA. To enable this, additional packages need to be installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to have a working [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) installation that is compatible with CuPy. To check type `nvcc --version` in your terminal.\n",
    "2. Install [cupy](https://cupy.dev). Make sure to install the cupy version matching your CUDA toolkit (e.g. `pip install cupy-cuda110` for CUDA toolkit 11.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes\n",
    " > To access Thermo files, we have integrated [RawFileReader](https://planetorbitrap.com/rawfilereader) into AlphaPept. We rely on [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) for Linux/Mac systems.\n",
    "\n",
    " > To access Bruker files, we rely on the `timsdata`-library. Currently, only Windows is supported. For feature finding, we use the Bruker Feature Finder, which can be found in the `ext` folder of this repository.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Notes for NBDEV\n",
    "\n",
    "* For developing with the notebooks, install the nbdev package (see the development requirements)\n",
    "* To facilitate navigating the notebooks, use jupyter notebook extensions. They can be called from a running jupyter instance like so: `http://localhost:8888/nbextensions`. The extensions `collapsible headings` and `toc2` are very beneficial.\n",
