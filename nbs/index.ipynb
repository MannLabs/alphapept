    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Standalone Windows Installer\n",
    "To use AlphaPept as a stand-alone program for end-users, it can be installed on Windows machines via a one-click installer. Download the latest version [here](http://alphapept.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) Python distribution which comes with a powerful package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is strongly recommended to install AlphaPept in its own environment.\n",
    "1. Open the console and create a new conda environment: `conda create --name alphapept python`\n",
    "2. Activate the environment: `source activate alphapept` for Linux / Mac Os X or `activate alphapept` for Windows\n",
    "2. Redirect to the folder of choice and clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapept.git`\n",
    "3. Install the packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "4. Install the package with `python setup.py install`\n",
    "5. Install pytables with `conda install pytables`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: If you would like to use alphapept in your jupyter notebook environment, additionally install nb_conda: `conda install nb_conda`. This also installs the juper notebook extensions. They can be called from a running jupyter instance like so: `http://localhost:8888/nbextensions`. For navigating the notebooks, the exension `collapsible headings` and `toc2` are very beneficial. For developing with the notebooks see the `nbev` section below.\n",

    "If AlphaPept is installed correctly, you should be able to import Alphapept as a package within the environment; see below."

    "## How to use\n",
    "\n",
    "AlphaPept is meant to be a framework to implement and test new ideas quickly but also to serve as a performant processing pipeline. In principle, there are three use-cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GUI: Use the graphical user interface to select settings and process files manually.\n",
    "* CMD: Use the command-line interface to process files. Useful when building automatic pipelines.\n",
    "* Python: Use python modules to build individual workflows. Useful when building customized pipelines and using Python as a scripting language or when implementing new ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the windows installation, simply click on the shortcut after installation. The windows installation also installs the command-line tool so that you can call alphapept via `alphapept` in the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Once AlphaPept is correctly installed, you can use it like any other python module."
